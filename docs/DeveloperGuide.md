## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete contact 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete contact 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete contact 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.
* Some commands contains secondary command, like `add contact`, `add note` and `add event`.
*   - In this case, the primary command parser (in the example it is `AddCommand`) will check the secondary command word and use the correspond secondary command parser (like `AddPersonCommandParser`, `AddEventCommandParser` and `AddNoteCommandParser`) to continue parsing the command.
* The parser will turn the arguments in the command from raw `String` into corresponding Object. During this process, the parser also needs to check whether the arguments are valid or not.
*   - The parsing method for each types of arguments are mainly in `ParserUtil.java`
* If the command is correct in format, the parser will then return a Command Object for the execution of the command.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component such as `Person`, `Note`, and `Event` because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Notes feature
This feature allows users to add and remove `Note` to any `Person` in the contact list. It provides an easy way for users to record additional information about the contacts.

#### Overview:
The adding and removing of `Note` begins with the parsing of the `AddNoteCommand` and `DeleteNoteCommand` using the `AddNoteCommandParser` and `DeleteNoteCommandParser` respectively. The `AddNoteCommand` and `DeleteNoteCommand` will then be executed by the `Model`.

The activity diagram below shows the action sequence of adding a `Note` to a contact.

<puml src="diagrams/note/NoteSequenceDiagram.puml"/>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The sequence diagram for removing `Note` is similar to adding `Note`. Simply replace `AddCommandParser` with `DeleteCommandParser`, `AddNoteCommandParser` with `DeleteNoteCommandParser`, and `AddNoteCommand` with `DeleteNoteCommand`.

</box>

##### Implementing `AddNoteCommandParser`
Implements the `Parser` interface, parsing three main arguments:
1. `contactId`: the one-based index of the contact shown in the GUI.
2. `noteTitle`: the title of the note to add.
3. `noteContent`: the content of the note to add.

`noteTitle` and `noteContent` are then used to create the `Note` object. After that, `contactId` and the `Note` object created are then used to create the `AddNoteCommand` object.

For the details of how parsing works, see the section on [Logic Component](#logic-component).

##### Implementing `DeleteNoteCommandParser`
Implements the `Parser` interface, parsing two main arguments:
1. `contactId`: the one-based index of the contact shown in the GUI.
2. `noteId`: the one-based index of the note shown in the GUI.

`contactId` and `noteId` are then used to create the `DeleteNoteCommand` object.

For the details of how parsing works, see the section on [Logic Component](#logic-component).

##### Implementing `AddNoteCommand`
`AddNoteCommand` extends from the abstract class `AddCommand`, inheriting `add` as the primary command word and having `note` as its secondary command word. It internally stores `contactId` (the index of the contact) and `toAdd` (the `Note` to add) which is given by the [parser](#implementing-addnotecommandparser).

When the command is executed, it carries out the following operations:
1. Using the `contactId`, it will first check if the `person` exist in the address book by calling `Model`'s `findPersonByUserFriendlyId` method.
    * A `CommandException` is thrown if the person does not exist. 
2. The note is then added to the person's note list by calling the `addNote` method in `Person`. 
3. Lastly a `CommandResult` with the success message is returned.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when `AddNoteCommand` is executed:

<puml src="diagrams/note/AddNoteActivityDiagram.puml"/>

##### Implementing `DeleteNoteCommand`
`DeleteNoteCommand` extends from the abstract class `DeleteCommand`, inheriting `delete` as the primary command word and having `note` as its secondary command word. It internally stores `contactId` (the index of the contact) and `noteIdToDelete` (the `Note` to delete) which is given by the [parser](#implementing-deletenotecommandparser).

When the command is executed, it carries out the following operations:
1. Using the `contactId`, it will first check if the `person` exist in the address book by calling `Model`'s `findPersonByUserFriendlyId` method.
    * A `CommandException` is thrown if the person does not exist.
2. Using the `noteIdToDelete`, it will delete the note from the person in the address book by calling `Person`'s `removeNoteByUserFriendlyId` method.
    * A `CommandException` is thrown if the note does not exist.
3. Lastly a `CommandResult` with the success message is returned.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the `DeleteNoteCommand` is executed:

<puml src="diagrams/note/DeleteNoteActivityDiagram.puml"/>

### Enhanced help feature

#### Design considerations:

**Rationale**

  * Previous help feature simply opens a page with a link to the website, this is bad because:
    * The flow is lengthy
    * User may not be able to access website when operating without the internet

    Therefore, we want to make this better by simplifying the flow. We do this by adding:
    * Making the help command return things in the application console
    * Letting users enter an extra argument to specify what command they need guiding on

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Planned Enhancements**

This section describes some enhancement that can be made to the existing app.

### User Interface

* In the current version, long names (usually longer than 40 characters) are truncated in the interface. Wrapping of names can be implemented so that long names are displayed in a more readable and user-friendly manner.
* The highlight of the contact entries is gray in color and the color of the text is white. The low contrast of the two colors decreases the readability of the texts. The color of the highlight can be changed to a darker color.
* The viewing the list of events using the `list events` command, the details of the contact which the event belongs to, is not present. This is incovenient for users as they will have to look through the contact list manually to find the contact. Future updates can append the contact details together with the event details when listing events.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
